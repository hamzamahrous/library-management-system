```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 3. Navigate to the frontend directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

### 4. Install project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

> 📦 This reads `package.json` and installs all required libraries.

---

### 5. Run the Angular development server

```bash
ng serve user
```

Or run on a specific port (e.g., 4200):

```bash
ng serve user --port 4200
```

## ✅ Done!

Visit [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser to access the frontend app.

### 🛠 Useful Scripts

If your `package.json` has custom scripts, you can use:

```bash
npm start
npm run build
```

---

> ⚠️ Make sure the backend server (Django) is running if your Angular app depends on it for API requests.
